During these days most of the channeling systems use manual systems to manage appointments, keep records of patients; doctors and drugs. This thesis presents our automated channeling center management system. We are going to develop an automated system as the solution that would be accessible by all personals who are related to this system. We expect the solution will give very encouraging results.
